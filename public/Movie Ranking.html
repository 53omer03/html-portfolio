<h3>The Hobbit Trilogy</h3>
<p>
  I know it's not a single movie, but this trilogy has to be watched all
  together.<br />
  it will take you to an amazing adventure in the world of Lord Of The Rings,
  and i promise you will love it whether you liked LOTR ot not!

<h3>The Avengers: ENDGAME</h3>
<p>
  The closing movie for the MCU ENDGAME Saga<br />

  i admit that if you havn't watched atleast the AVENGERS moveis, then this
  movie will be hard to understand, but it's an amazing movie with excellent
  actors, so go watch it!
